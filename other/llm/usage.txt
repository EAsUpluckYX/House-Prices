Beautify the table. No Html.
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# model 2: 
## Based on AIC ##
model.lm <- lm(median_house_value ~ ., data = train[,-c(1)])

summary(model.lm) 


n <- nrow(train)
sel.var.aic <- step(model.lm, trace = 0, k = 2, direction = "both") 
sel.var.aic<-attr(terms(sel.var.aic), "term.labels")   
sel.var.aic
```

Certainly, to create a more aesthetically pleasing and non-HTML table in an R Markdown document, you can use the kable function from the knitr package in combination with functions from the kableExtra package. This combination will allow you to create a nicely formatted table in PDF or Word format instead of HTML.

Here’s how you could modify your code to produce a cleaner table in a non-HTML format such as LaTeX (for PDF output):
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# model 2: 
## Based on AIC ##
model.lm <- lm(median_house_value ~ ., data = train[,-c(1)])
summary(model.lm) 

# Using AIC for model selection
n <- nrow(train)
sel.var.aic <- step(model.lm, trace = 0, k = 2, direction = "both") 
sel.var.aic <- attr(terms(sel.var.aic), "term.labels")   

# Creating a nicer table using kable and kableExtra
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

kable(sel.var.aic, col.names = "Selected Variables", align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "center", font_size = 12) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#56B4E9") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "10cm")

In this code:

The kable function creates the basic table.
kable_styling from kableExtra is used to apply additional styling to the table, such as centering it, setting full width to false, and adjusting the font size.
row_spec is used to change the appearance of the header row, making it bold and changing the background color.
column_spec can be used to adjust the width of specific columns for better presentation.
Please note, the appearance settings (such as color and background) are illustrative and can be adjusted to your preference. To ensure these features work, you need to have the kableExtra package installed and you should be rendering to a PDF. If you’re rendering to a Word document, some LaTeX-specific features will not work and you will need to adjust your formatting accordingly.

Can you beautify the summary as well?

To beautify the summary output of a linear model in R, you can use the broom package to tidy the output and kable from knitr along with kableExtra for creating a more presentable table format. Here’s how you could adjust your R code:
# Load necessary libraries
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Fit the model (assuming 'train' data frame is already in your environment)
model.lm <- lm(median_house_value ~ ., data = train[,-c(1)])

# Create a tidy summary table of the model
tidy_model <- tidy(model.lm)

# Create a kable table with some custom styling
kable(tidy_model, caption = "Summary of Linear Model", format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2d3e50") %>%
  column_spec(2:5, background = "#f7f7f7")

In this code snippet:

tidy(model.lm) is used to turn the summary of the linear model into a clean dataframe.
kable() creates a table with the tidy summary.
kable_styling() and column_spec() from kableExtra are used to apply styling such as striping, position holding, and custom column colors.
Remember that this code will work if you're knitting to a PDF since it uses LaTeX for styling. If you are knitting to an HTML document, you can remove the format = "latex" argument and adjust styling options as HTML supports different styling functions.

Also, ensure that the kableExtra package is installed in your R environment to use these features.

set.seed(1007218397)

best.lambda
co<-coef(cv.out, s = "lambda.1se")

beautify best.lambda

To beautify the output of best.lambda in your R Markdown document, you can again use knitr::kable() combined with kableExtra. Here's an updated version of your code chunk that includes a formatted output table for the best.lambda value:
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(glmnet)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Perform cross-validation to choose lambda for LASSO
set.seed(1007218397)
train <- na.omit(train)
cv.out <- cv.glmnet(x = as.matrix(train[,c(3,5,6,8)]), y = train$median_house_value, 
                    standardize = TRUE, alpha = 1)

best.lambda <- cv.out$lambda.1se

# Create a data frame for pretty printing
lambda_table <- data.frame(Best_Lambda = best.lambda)

# Print the table using kable
kable(lambda_table, caption = "Best Lambda Value from LASSO Model", 
      digits = 4, align = 'c', format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2d3e50")

This code chunk will create a LaTeX formatted table when you knit to PDF, displaying the value of best.lambda in an attractive, readable format. The table will be striped for easier readability, and the column header will be bold and styled with a specified background color. If you're knitting to HTML, you'll want to omit the format = "latex" argument and use the appropriate HTML styling functions instead.
